HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT Applications/Webpages

This application is my first in the relem of HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT, the application works by allowing the user to input a grade into the cell underneath each of the 5 assignments which will then when a button at the bottom of the table is pressed and will then get the average of the 5 assignments and will then put the average into the final results cells.If the average grade is less than 40 the cell will have a red background and white font otherwise it will be white background with black font.It does this for all 10 people in the table.The Fianl grade will be rounded up to the nearest whole number and will not output a decimal.
